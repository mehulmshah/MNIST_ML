# MNIST_ML
Practicing my Python skills by implementing various ML classification algorithms on the MNIST dataset.

I'll be uploading my personal implementation as I write them.

To try these out, you'll have to download the MNIST data, and install some python modules. I'll keep an updated list here of which modules I'm using.

Module List:

numpy

pandas

scipy

os

I'm using a CSV formatted version of MNIST, as the original is a pain to parse into python. It can be downloaded here:

If you want to work with the original MNIST, that can be downloaded here:
